Installfest: Getting Set Up
===========================

## Requirements

Everyone in the workshop should have a laptop. If it is running Windows, it should be running Windows 7 or above. If it is running OS X, it should be running 10.7 "Lion" or above. If it is running Linux, you are probably fine.

If anyone attending does not have access to a laptop running one of the above choices, let the instructors know. You can pair with someone else.

## What we are installing

### All students:

By the end of these instructions, you will have the following installed:

* Java, a "virtual machine" that Clojure runs atop of
* Nightcode, an editor for Clojure and other programming languages

You also will have to get Clojure projects (starting code) that you will be working with. These are different for different tracks. 

## Instructions by operating system

Choose your operating system to get setup instructions:

* [OS X](setup_osx.md)
* [Windows 7](setup_win7.md)
* [Windows 8](setup_win8.md)
* [Ubuntu Linux](setup_ubuntu.md)

After you have installed Java and Nightcode, you need to get the projects you will be working on.
 
## Getting the projects

Clojure projects have some starting Clojure code and some organizational tools. Follow your track instructions. At the end of the installation process there are instructions to verify that your setup works as it should.

* [Track 1: turtles](setup_track1.md)
* [Track 2: Clojure koans](setup_track2.md)

## Don't forget to: 

* Join the Boston [ClojureBridge learners](https://clojurebridge-ma.slack.com/messages/learners/team/) slack channel: a place to ask and answer Clojure questions during and after the workshop. Check your email for an invitation.
